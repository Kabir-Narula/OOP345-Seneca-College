## Personal Notes

Amidst my journey in this course, I've compiled comprehensive notes that delve into the core topics and concepts of C++. These notes are a treasure trove of knowledge, spanning fundamentals of the language, object-oriented programming, control statements, arrays, functions, and file handling, among others. With practical examples and exercises woven in, these notes stand as a valuable resource for beginners and those seeking to deepen their C++ expertise. Feel free to access the course notes at [C++ Workshop Notes](https://github.com/LeviAcker25/C--Plus-Plus-Notes). It's my hope that these resources assist you in your endeavor to evolve into a skilled C++ developer. Happy learning!

## Project Structure

This repository is organized in a structured manner, with each workshop and milestone having its own dedicated directory. Inside each directory, you'll find detailed explanations of the assignments, along with the corresponding source code and any additional resources used. I've also included README files within each directory to provide context and insights into the solutions.

## Disclaimer

I would like to clarify that the content shared in this repository is intended solely for educational and informational purposes. The code, assignments, and project milestones posted here are a representation of my individual work accomplished during my C++ Workshop course. While I encourage fellow students to harness this repository for inspiration and learning, it's pivotal to uphold academic integrity and ethical conduct.

**Copying, reproducing, or submitting code from this repository as your own for academic assignments is a breach of academic integrity**. It's indispensable to grasp the concepts, principles, and coding techniques provided here and to apply them autonomously to your own work.

Utilizing this repository as a reference is laudable, but direct replication sans authentic comprehension not only undermines your learning journey but also compromises the very essence of education and progress. Proper attribution and acknowledgment are paramount should you opt to incorporate any concepts or ideas from this repository into your projects or assignments.

By accessing and utilizing the content within this repository, you affirm that you comprehend the significance of academic integrity ([Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.senecacollege.ca/about/policies/academic-integrity-policy.html)) and that you'll use this material prudently to enrich your learning voyage.
